# ðŸ”¥ Fire and Smoke Detection System using AI and IOT

This project is an AI-powered real-time fire and smoke detection system. It combines object detection using the YOLO model with FastAPI for API management, and Firebase for real-time sensor data monitoring and control. The system is designed for quick response to fire hazards in indoor or outdoor environments.
