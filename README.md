# ðŸ”¥ Fire and Smoke Detection System

This project is designed to help detect fire and smoke in real-time using a camera. It can automatically start working when dangerous levels of heat or gas are detected, helping to prevent disasters before they happen.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Does

- Detects **fire** and **smoke** in live video from a camera
- Uses sensor data (like temperature or gas levels) to know when to start checking
- Sends alerts and saves information when danger is found
- Can be used in homes, offices, factories, or outdoor areas

## ðŸŽ¯ Why We Built This

Early detection of fire and smoke can save lives and property. We wanted to create a system that works **quickly**, **accurately**, and doesnâ€™t need expensive hardware. It can run on a simple setup and can be used in many real-world situations.
